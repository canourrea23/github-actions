# Testing GitHub Actions w/ Cypress

Will ignore specs based on `cypress.json` config options

## Notes:
- Syntax can include [], but it is not necessary
- The option to run configs based on conditionals can be found in branch [`conditional`](https://github.com/conversaShawn/github-actions/tree/conditional)
